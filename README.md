Mst-solver is a library to resolve the mst problem by using prim's algorithm, developed for prolog and lisp.

## Heap🔗
As required by the prim's algorithm, there is also a heap implementation in the library.

## About🧐

This library was created as a university project for an exam, so I apologize that the documentation is in Italian,
if requested I will traduce it in English in the future.

## Usage
Use it as a simple prolog/lisp file.
